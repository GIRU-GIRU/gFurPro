# gFur Information

For now (this is not a license, license is provided in a separate file):
- gFur is open source
- it's free for non-commercial use
- in a hope to get it back on track and work with UE5.XX we will grant free commercial licenses to meaningful donations of bug-fixes and updates that make it work in latest UE versions
- if you are interested in a commercial license without donating fixes/updates, contact us at gfur@gim.studio
